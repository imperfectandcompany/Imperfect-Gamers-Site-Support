Attacking or targeting any individual or peoples for their ethnicity, religion, sexual preference or gender is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the community.\n**Doxxing:** Attempting to discover or provide the personal information of another member of the community will result in a permanent ban.\n**Advertisement & Promotion:** Imperfect Gamers is not your billboard. Don't drop your Soundcloud, Twitch, YouTube, Instagram, or any other socials here. If you want to share your socials with someone, add them and DM them. You are also allowed to have your socials in your Steam profile. Joining with a link in your player name will result in a kick on the first offense, and a ban on the second. The only exceptions to this are CS:GO item websites.\n**Ban Evasion:** If a ban is currently active on any of your accounts, connecting to IG servers on an alternate account will result in that account also being banned, an extension applied to your existing ban, and an IP ban for the duration. The use of VPNs or proxies is not allowed and will result in a ban.",

Examples of text spam would be repeated use of chat binds, or constantly typing nonsense. Examples of voice chat include making repeated noises, playing sound clips, holding your mic button down for no reason or using voice activation. 'Ear Spam' also falls into this category.\n**Interruption:** In the same vein as voice spam, do not interrupt another member while they are rapping. Examples of interruption include asking to get on the mic because you want to rap, laughing at their lyrics, and adlibs.\n**Toxic Behavior:** Attacking, threatening or disrespecting other members or staff fall under this category. The exception to this rule is in the context of a rap battle. Punishments will range from a 30 minute mute to a permanent ban. The length is at the discretion of the Imperfect Gamers staff.",

Similarly, if no beat is playing, feel free to throw one on.\n**Hogging the Mic:** Sometimes it is easy to get carried away while rapping; just remember to pass the mic once in a while. Typically, if there's other people that want to rap, try to keep your bars limited to 30 seconds.\n**Beats & Songs:** You are welcome to play your own beats, or beats you found online. While meme beats and actual songs aren't strictly against the rules, you should avoid playing them without expressed permission from a staff member currently on the server. Similarly, you are permitted to play full songs so long as everyone is okay with it. If people want you to turn it off, you should turn it off.\n**Writtens:** If you want to spit a written, you must ensure that the server is fine with it beforehand. Do not spit writtens without disclosing it first.\n**CallAdmin:** Inside the server, there is a command called '!calladmin'. This command is for reporting rule abusers. Any misuse of this command could result in a temporary ban. This command is only for reporting rule violations, not for general announcements or non-urgent messages. Please use it responsibly.",

                "Over the past few years, the ban process on Imperfect Gamers has been adjusted accordingly to better suit the interests of the players.\n\n**10/16/2017:** I've had several questions about how harsh you should be on people for various reasons. To answer this, it should be up to you. My only advice on this would be, that if it's intentionally something malicious, that deserves a more severe punishment. We do have the rule about the hard R being an instant ban, however less severe infractions often depend on the context, hence the point about maliciousness. If you are unsure about how harsh you should be to any situation, don't be shy to ask.\n**10/30/2017:** First of all welcome to everyone that's new. I just want to give a few reminders. If you ban someone, it might not show in chat. The ban went through if no error message shows up. Other players should be able to see the ban. Also, if you are unfamiliar with the commands, we have a google docs sheet with all the commands on it, plus some more stuff. If you need that sheet, contact me or Daiyaan. Finally, remember that punishment should be decided by you. Obviously make sure whatever you do is justifiable, because we do keep a watch. If we feel you are not giving punishment, or giving it beyond reason, you will be notified. With that being said, hard R should always be a ban. Really shouldn't ever be less than a week, unless the circumstance calls for it (like a misunderstanding). Anyway thanks for listening, us staff and Daiyaan are always here to help out. If you need anything, let us know!\n**Aug 9, 2017:** Due to an increasingly overwhelming number of ban-appeals on the discord it was then decided to move these applications somewhere more publicly accessible such as in the Steam group discussion.",

In the top right hand corner, you will see a button that says 'admin'. Click this. This will take you to the login page. 3. If the Steam login does not work, then you need to have an account set up. Hit up Lew G and give him your email; he will add it to your SourceBans account and then you can do a 'forgot password' to set up the login info.\n**Adding a ban:** 1. Navigate to the admin panel by clicking on the 'admin panel' button on the navbar or by clicking here. 2. Click 'bans' or go here. 3. Click 'Add a ban'. 4. From here, you can add a ban on someone's community ID, steamid or by IP. Make sure you select the appropriate type of ban.\n**Editing a ban:** 1. Navigate to our bans page or click here. 2. Click on the ban you want to edit (or use advanced search to find it) 3. Click 'Edit Details'. 4. From here, you can change the length of the ban or remove the ban entirely.\n**Server management:** 1. Navigate to the servers page by clicking the 'servers' button on the navbar or by going here. 2. Click on a server to expand it. 3. Right click a player. 4. Click kick/ban/mute as needed.\n**An extra little note:** Steam ID Finder is a useful website for getting someone's steam/community IDs from their profile name.",
